        <p>The Yamaha RD350 was a two-stroke motorcycle that was manufactured by Escorts Group in India from 1983 to 1991. The RD350 was marketed as the Rajdoot 350 in the domestic market under license from Yamaha Japan. The motorcycle was taken off the market in 1991 owing to stricter emission norms, scarce parts availability, and high fuel consumption.<br>
        The India-spec Yamaha RD350 sourced power from a 347 cc, air-cooled, two-stroke, parallel twin-cylinder engine that was capable of producing 30.5 bhp of maximum power and 32 Nm of peak torque, mated to a six-speed gearbox. The Indian model was based on the Yamaha RD350B.</p>
